# 🧠 Resume Screening Bot (NLP + PDF + ML)

This project is an **AI-powered resume screening system** that uses NLP and machine learning to classify resumes as **Accept / Reject / Maybe** based on text content, skill match, and job requirements.

It supports both **PDF resume parsing** and **text classification**, making it ideal for recruitment automation and HR tech tools.
